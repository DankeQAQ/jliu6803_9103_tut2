## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I was inspired by the comet scene from the anime film "Your Name". In this scene, a bright comet splits across the sky, leaving behind a glowing trail that slowly dissolves into the stars. I want to incorporate this flowing light effect into my project based on Van Gogh‚Äôs ‚ÄúStarry Night‚Äù. Instead of a static painting, I hope to animate the brushstroke directions to mimic the motion of wind or comet trails, giving the artwork a sense of dynamic energy and emotion. This flowing motion aligns well with the swirling visual texture of the original painting.

## üíª Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

Our project is based on Van Gogh‚Äôs *Starry Night*. To recreate the visual effect of the comet streaking across the night sky in *Your Name*, I plan to use flow fields and particle systems in p5.js. A flow field generated by Perlin noise can produce smooth and organic movement paths, simulating how a comet moves through the sky. The particle system lets me control each particle‚Äôs speed, direction, and lifespan, making it possible to create a dynamic comet tail effect.
